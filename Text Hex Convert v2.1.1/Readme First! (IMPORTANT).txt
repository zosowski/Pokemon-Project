Before you can convert, select wich .ini file you wish to use first. The "Pokemon Hex Values.ini" contains the hex equivalent - and vice-versa - of each characters to be used in different hacks, like changing the ingame battle messages. 

The "Standard.ini",  however, is different. It contains the standard hex equivalent of the the alphabet and all special characters. So bear that in mind when using the tool.
