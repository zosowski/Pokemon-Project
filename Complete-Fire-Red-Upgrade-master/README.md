# Complete Fire Red Upgrade

## What is this?
A complete upgrade for FireRed, including an upgraded Battle Engine. By using this or any assets from this repository, you consent to never making money off your game (unless you have my explicit permission). That includes both pay-walls **as well as optional donations** (which includes ko-fi, Patreon, etc.). If you have a problem with this, feel free to send me a Discord message (Skeli#3917) and I will give you my PayPal so you can pay me $100000 for the hundreds if not thousands of hours I poured into this for **free** (I don't actually want your money - I'm trying to make a point). Not to mention it's illegal to profit off of an IP you don't own.

**Before doing anything it is HIGHLY recommended the documentation be read thoroughly.**

## Installation Instructions
### Windows
See [the wiki](https://github.com/Skeli789/Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade/wiki/Windows-Installation-Instructions).

### UNIX-like OS (Linux, MacOS, ...)
1. Install devkitPro with instructions [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

2. Export `${DEVKITARM}/bin/` to your `PATH` variable.

3. Make sure you've installed python 3.6+ and it can be called directly via either `python` or `python3`.

4. Clone the repo and go inside:   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skeli789/Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade
cd Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade
```

5. Get your ROM into the current directory and rename it to **BPRE0.gba**.

6. Configure the offset you want to insert the code:
In *scripts/make.py* change `OFFSET_TO_PUT=YYY` to the location you want to insert the data.

7. Run `python scripts/make.py` (or `python3 scripts/make.py` if you’ve installed multiple python versions).

A new gba file will appear named as **test.gba** and an **offsets.ini** file.
Those are your resultant files.

## Notes

Anytime you make changes, the compiler will only compile the files you have changed.

### Specific to Windows
Any changes made to header files will require you to type ``python scripts//clean.py build``
in cmd and then rerun the build scripts. For more command line options, see "Engine
Scripts" in the documentation.

### Specific to UNIX-like OS (linux, macOS, ...):
Any changes made to header files will require you to clean everything in *build/* and then rerun the build scripts.
